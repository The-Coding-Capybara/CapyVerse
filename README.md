# CapyVerse

## This Repo
This repo is a collection of personal projects, 
experiments, and prototypes â€” mostly in **Python** 
and **R**, with a mix of finance, data science, and random 
curiosities. Inspired by the most beautiful animal on the
planet, tha capybara.

## Shared Functions

Functions that are used across multilple projects are stored in the shared 
directory, this includes CaPy (for python functions) and CapybaRa (R functions).

## Credentials

The projects in this repository use several APIs to get data, some
of which require credentials to be parsed. All credentials should be
saved in the Credentials directory. Please use the example .ini files
to set up your own credentials to these APIs, when you have entered
your own credentials please remove the '-example' from the name of 
the .ini file. These are in the .gitignore so should not make it to
the repository.
